thunderdome
===========

<img align="center" src="https://raw.github.com/StartTheShift/thunderdome/master/docs/logo.png" alt="Thunderdome Logo" />

thunderdome is an object-graph mapper (OGM) designed specifically for use with
Titan (http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/) via Rexster
(https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki). Thunderdome supports easily
integrating Gremlin graph-traversals with vertex and edge models. For those
already familiar with Blueprints (https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki)
there is a [simple example](https://github.com/StartTheShift/thunderdome/wiki/Quick-Start).

Installation
============

```shell
$ pip install thunderdome
```

Quick start
===========

A [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual environment is provided with the
thunderdome repository. This will setup a Titan/Rexster server in a virtual
environment and provides an easy way to get up and running with thunderdome.
To get the virtual environment up and running simply do the following:

```shell
$ cd path/to/thunderdome
$ vagrant up
...
$ vagrant ssh
...
vagrant@precise64:~$ cd /vagrant
```

This will put you in the thunderdome directory in the vagrant box. You can now
run the unit-tests or start playing around within the python shell.

Check out the [Quick Start](https://github.com/StartTheShift/thunderdome/wiki/Quick-Start) page for a simple
introduction to working with thunderdome.

Unit-tests
==========

To get thunderdome unit tests running you'll need a rexster server configured with a thunderdome graph.  

``` xml
<graph>
    <graph-name>thunderdome</graph-name>
    <graph-type>com.thinkaurelius.titan.tinkerpop.rexster.TitanGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
    <graph-read-only>false</graph-read-only>
    <graph-location>/tmp/thunderdome</graph-location>
    <properties>
          <storage.backend>local</storage.backend>
          <storage.directory>/tmp/thunderdome</storage.directory>
          <buffer-size>100</buffer-size>
    </properties>

    <extensions>
      <allows>
        <allow>tp:gremlin</allow>
      </allows>
    </extensions>
</graph>
```
